title: Regression in release r151022s
---

Due to a reported regression in CIFS behaviour with r151022s, we have
temporarily removed the CIFS related fixes while we investigate.

If you updated to r151022s before 00:00 UTC, use CIFS file sharing,
and experience any problems, you can downgrade the affected package
manually by invoking:

`pkg update pkg://omnios/system/file-system/smb@0.5.11-0.151022:20170714T222015Z`

If you have any linked image zones on the system, don't forget to add 
a `-r` after `update`.

More information will appear here and on our
[Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/OmniOSce)
as we work on a resolution.
