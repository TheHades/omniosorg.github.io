title: Installing MariaDB in a sparse zone
synopsis: Installing MariaDB in a sparse zone
---

I have recently done some work on improving the MariaDB 10.4 package that is
part of the OmniOS extra package repository, to add more features and to make
it easier to deploy. Part of that work involved adding support for socket
authentication which makes the default installation more secure.

Here's a walk-through of creating a sparse zone on OmniOS r151032, and then
installing MariaDB within that. Commands that are issued within the global
zone are shown with a prompt of `gz#`, and those within the sparse zone
itself are prefixed with `database#`, which is the name of the zone.

### Pre-requisites

Before you can create a sparse zone, the zone brand must be installed and
you'll need a ZFS dataset to act as a zone container. If you've used zones
before, you might already have these in place.

```
gz# pkg install zones brand/sparse
```

```
gz# zfs create -o mountpoint=/zones rpool/zones
```

### Zone creation

In this example I am attaching a VNIC for the zone to an Etherstub called
_switch10_. If you just want to attach it to a global zone NIC, then you
can specify `global-nic=auto` and it will usually do the right thing.

```
gz# zonecfg -z database
database: No such zone configured
Use 'create' to begin configuring a new zone.
zonecfg:database> create -t sparse
zonecfg:database> set zonepath=/zones/database
zonecfg:database> add net
zonecfg:database:net> set physical=database0
zonecfg:database:net> set global-nic=switch10
zonecfg:database:net> set allowed-address=172.27.10.7/24
zonecfg:database:net> set defrouter=172.27.10.254
zonecfg:database:net> end
zonecfg:database> add attr
zonecfg:database:attr> set name=resolvers
zonecfg:database:attr> set type=string
zonecfg:database:attr> set value=1.1.1.1
zonecfg:database:attr> end
zonecfg:database> add attr
zonecfg:database:attr> set name=domain-name
zonecfg:database:attr> set type=string
zonecfg:database:attr> set value=omnios.org
zonecfg:database:attr> end
zonecfg:database> verify
zonecfg:database> exit
```

### Zone installation

```
gz# zoneadm -z database install
A ZFS file system has been created for this zone.

### Zone boot

```
gz# zoneadm -z database boot
gz# zlogin database
```

Wait for the initial boot to complete by checking the output of the
`svcs -x` command. Once this command returns no output, the zone is fully up.

Check IP connectivity:

```
root@database:~# ipadm
ADDROBJ           TYPE     STATE        ADDR
lo0/v4            static   ok           127.0.0.1/8
database0/_a      from-gz  ok           172.27.10.7/24
lo0/v6            static   ok           ::1/128

root@database:~# ping google.com
google.com is alive
```

### Mariadb installation

```
root@database:~# pkg list -a '*mariadb*'

```

```

Release Notes:

  --------------------------
  MariaDB Installation Notes
  --------------------------

  When the mariadb service is started for the first time, an initial
  database will be set up and two all-privilege accounts will be created.

  One is root@localhost, it has no password, but you need to
  be system 'root' user to connect. Use, for example, 'sudo mysql'

  The second is mysql@localhost, it has no password either, but
  you need to be the system 'mysql' user to connect.

  You may wish to review the default configuration file at
  /etc/opt/ooce/mariadb-<version>/my.cnf before starting the service
  for the first time.

that root has an invalid (non-matchable) password hash.
