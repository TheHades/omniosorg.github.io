title: OmniOS Community Edition r151022l
---

This is the weekly update for w/c 7th of August 2017 and contains NO security updates but several bugfixes from upstream illumos and joyent lx. For this update, a reboot is required.

We are aware that system reboots pose a problem for many sites, so we are investigating ways to reduce the requirements of reboots associated with update releases of OmniOSce. More on this next week.

Full release notes can be found at 

[github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151022/doc/ReleaseNotes.md](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151022/doc/ReleaseNotes.md)

To upgrade, utter: 

```
pkg update -r --be-name=r151022l
```
