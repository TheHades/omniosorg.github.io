title: OmniOSce Release Schedule
---

In response to our call for someone to step up to take over responsibility to maintain OmniOS LTS releases we received a number of detailed responses, but only from people interested in using the product and none who wanted to help maintain it.

After careful consideration of all the input, the OmniOSce Association has decided to continue maintaining LTS releases of OmniOSce. LTS releases will be supported for three years with intervening stable releases being supported for one year. LTS releases will therefore overlap for a year to allow time for validation and upgrade even in complex environments. Regular stable releases will overlap for six months.

This results in the following release schedule with r151024 being targeted for the first week of November 2017.
