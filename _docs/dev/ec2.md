# Creating an EC2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

The first step is to install an OmniOS image onto a new virtual 8GiB hard disk
along with a modified ZFS-enabled version of grub.

The [kayak](https://github.com/omniosorg/kayak) repository contains a
script do do this for you.

Install OmniOS into a KVM (or use an existing OmniOS build VM) and then
create an additional 8GiB hard disk and attach it to the VM.

Run the following commands, substituting the version for the one you
need:

```
% pkg install git
% it clone https://github.com/omniosorg/kayak
% d kayak
% get https://downloads.omniosce.org/media/stable/omniosce-r151024.zfs.bz2
% pfexec ./build_xen.sh
```
> NB: sudo can be used for privilege escalation in place of pexec if you have
> it configured.

You will be prompted to confirm that you wish to build the image on the
8GiB disk. All data on that disk will be lost.

At the end of the process information about the new pool will be printed
and one of the attributes will be the physical path which will look something
like this:

```
phys_path: '/pci@0,0/pci1af4,2@5/blkdev@0,0:a'
```

# Correcting the phys_path label

This phys_path value from the label is used to set bootpath= kernel boot option
when pv-grub is expanding $ZFS-BOOTFS macro. Therefore the value stored in the
pool's label needs to match the disk device name in EC2 environment. When
booted in EC2 environment, the first disk will be represented by
`/xpvd/xdf@2048` device, the second by `/xpvd/xdf@2064` and so on.

In order to correct the label, the pool needs to be imported into an
environment similar to EC2 and for this we will use an instance of Debian+Xen
running inside KVM on OmniOS.

> Yes, this is convoluted. If you know of a better way to change the
> phys_path attribute on a pool, please let us know!

Once Debian is installed, add the xen hypervisor software and reboot into
the Xen kernel:

```
root@xen:/# apt install xen-hypervisor-4.8-amd64
root@xen:/# shutdown -r now
```

Attach the 8GiB virtual disk that was created in the previous step. This should
appear as /dev/vdb.

```
root@xen:/# fdisk -l /dev/vdb
Disk /dev/vdb: 8 GiB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors
...
Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type
/dev/vdb1        2048    34815    32768  16M  6 FAT16
/dev/vdb2       34816 16777215 16742400   8G bf Solaris
```

Grab a copy of the OmniOS installer, pv grub and create a Xen config file:

```
root@xen:/# wget https://downloads.omniosce.org/media/r151024/omniosce-r151024.iso
root@xen:/# wget https://downloads.omniosce.org/media/misc/pv-grub.gz.d3950d8
root@xen:/# cat omnios.xen
memory = 2048 
name = 'omnios' 
vcpus = 4 
disk = [ 'file:/dev/vdb,2048,w',
         'file:/omniosce-r151024.iso,2064,r' ] 
kernel = "/pv-grub.gz.d3950d8" 
extra = "(hd1)/boot/grub/menu.lst"
```

Start Xen and you should see a grub prompt:

```
root@xen:/# xl create omnios.xen -c

    GNU GRUB  version 0.97  (1048576K lower / 0K upper memory)

       [ Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported.   For
         the   first   word,  TAB  lists  possible  command
         completions.  Anywhere else TAB lists the possible
         completions of a device/filename. ]

grubdom>
```

At the grub prompt, enter the following four commands:

```
root (hd1)
kernel$ /platform/i86pc/kernel/$ISADIR/unix
module$ /platform/i86pc/$ISADIR/boot_archive
boot
```

You will enter the OmniOS installer and, after selecting a keyboard layout,
choose the option to drop to a shell.

Import the root pool `syspool`, exit the shell and then select the `Halt`
option from the menu.

```
bash-4.4# zpool import -R /a -f syspool
bash-4.4# exit
```

If you were now to re-attach the disk to an OmniOS system and query the
pool `phys_path` property, you would see an EC2 compatible value:

```
# zdb -e -C syspool | grep phys_path
                phys_path: '/xpvd/xdf@2048:a'
```

# Uploading the image to AWS

TBC...

```
# ec2-import-volume -o $AWS_ACCESS_KEY -w $AWS_SECRET_KEY -f raw -b <bucket> -z eu-west-2a /dev/zvol/rdsk/data/omniosce/hdd-ec2
```
