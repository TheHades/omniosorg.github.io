tool to create and manage zones on OmniOS from release r151034. New videos
will be posted to this page over the coming weeks.

_lx_-branded zone and how to configure a basic policy in the zone firewall.
The zone firewall works for all zone brands except for _KVM_ and is ideal for
securing an lx zone where the native iptables tools don't work.

This is just a basic zone setup. Configuring more features such as memory
and CPU caps will be covered in a future post.
