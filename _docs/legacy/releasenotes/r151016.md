[r151016 release repository](http://pkg.omniti.com/omnios/r151016/)

Please read the [upgrade instructions](/legacy/upgrade_to_r151014)
carefully. They were written for r151014, but they apply to r151016 as
well.

### What's new in this release?

* GCC 5.1 now available, and replaces GCC 4.8 in omnios-userland. (illumos bits
  are still built with the illumos-custom GCC 4.4.4). GCC 5.1 also has mediated
  symlinks for `gcc` in `/usr/bin` now as well. 
  **NOTE: GCC 5.1's default standard is `-std=gnu11`. This is a change from GCC 4's
  `-std=gnu89`. Some software may assume gnu89, and to compile it with GCC 5, you'll
  need to specify `-std=gnu89` or update your software.**
* New simple metapackage for building illumos:  [illumos-tools](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-wiki/blob/master/illumos-tools.md)
* Part of illumos-tools is the illumos-closed package, which contains the tarballs
  and expanded-as-root closed-binaries for illumos distros
* The signing certificate for r151016 uses SHA-256 for its hash
* OpenSSH 7.1 can now be used as the system's default SSH daemon. New installs will
  install OpenSSH 7.1 by default. To switch from SunSSH to OpenSSH (remove `--no-backup-be`
  if you wish to generate backup Boot Environments):
  ```
  # /usr/bin/pkg install --no-backup-be --reject pkg:/network/ssh --reject pkg:/network/ssh/ssh-key --reject pkg:/service/network/ssh pkg:/network/openssh pkg:/network/openssh-server
  ```
  To switch from OpenSSH to SunSSH:
  ```
  # /usr/bin/pkg install --no-backup-be --reject pkg:/network/openssh --reject pkg:/network/openssh-server pkg:/network/ssh pkg:/network/ssh/ssh-key pkg:/service/network/ssh
  ```
  **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Switching from SunSSH to OpenSSH will require commenting-out `MaxAuthTriesLog`
  and `RhostsAuthentication` options from `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Also both `ListenAddress`
  directives MUST be commented out (SunSSH has one uncommented by default). There will be an
  `sshd_config.new` to consult
  **IMPORTANT NOTE 2 (Thanks Andy Fiddaman)**: To continue allowing connections from SunSSH, please add
  `KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1` to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and ALSO if you have entries
  in `/etc/pam.conf` to update them. For example, Andy needed to `s/sshd-kbdint/sshd/` to re-enable
  their two-factor authentication
* Network performance test tools iperf and netperf now in the omnios repo
* Updates for screen to have 256 colors
* illumos distributed make (dmake) is now open-source
* GNU make is now up to version 4.1 (requested by many)
* Updated timezone (2015g) and HW information (PCI, USB, and SMBIOS)
* arc4random(3c) family of library calls
* One can serve SMB/CIFS from a non-global zone, see
  [here](http://www.listbox.com/member/archive/182179/2015/04/sort/time_rev/page/1/entry/5:475/20150428134823:C190ED2C-EDCE-11E4-98D2-8987C5A0D07F/)
  for details
* AVL trees are now a stable public interface
* IOPS, bandwidth, and latency kstats for NFS server
* Support for linux-like eventfd, epoll, and timerfd
* NVME 1.0 support
* New checksums for ZFS: SHA-512, Skein, Edon-R
* useradd/userdel/usermod is now ZFS aware
* Resumable ZFS send & receive
* Many other illumos-provided improvements in ZFS, documentation, small fixes, and more
