## r151020 release

Stable Release, November 4, 2016

illumos-omnios branch r151020 at [b5b8c75](https://omnios.omniti.com/changeset.php/core/illumos-omnios/b5b8c75)

`uname -a` shows omnios-r151020-b5b8c75

Last full illumos-gate merge was [b6bc2fd](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/b6bc2fd).
Because of high upstream churn, this is earlier than most OmniOS stable releases. Several cherrypicks
of device support occurred after the freeze

r151020 release repository: [r151020](http://pkg.omniti.com/omnios/r151020/)

Please read the [upgrade instructions](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-wiki/blob/master/Upgrade_to_r151020.md)
carefully. The end-of-life for SunSSH means SunSSH-deployments must
change over to OpenSSH.

### What's NOT new in this release?

**NOTE**: The BSD Loader, ASLR, and Python2.7-for-illumos are **NOT**
included in this release. The sample .env files shipped in the `illumos-tools` package,
used for building `illumos-omnios`, reflect this by setting the `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable to `2.6`.
This allows one to build both future `illumos-omnios` and current `illumos-gate` on r151020.

It is currently planned that during the next Bloody cycle (r151021) and
its following LTS release (r151022) these major features and changes
will be matured and integrated into OmniOS.

### What is new in this release?

* **LX Zones (beta)** - this feature has [its own page](../../info/lxzones.html)
* SunSSH has reached its End-of-Life and is no longer included in OmniOS, having
  been fully replaced by OpenSSH.
  **Important:** it is preferred that an upgrade to OpenSSH is done **prior** to
  installing OmniOS r151020. See the [upgrade instructions](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-wiki/blob/master/Upgrade_to_r151020.md)
  for how to successfully transition if you have not already abandoned SunSSH
* Introduction of the `omnios/library/nghttp` library package, allowing HTTP/2
  support in the shipped curl(1) and libcurl(3)
* VIM is now at version 8.0. The default for `vi` was always `vim`. With version 8.0,
  this is now more noticeable
* All driver improvements already in r151018 updates
* Timezone database update to version 2016h
* Several small NVMe fixes, culminating in introductory NVMe 1.1 support
* Intel I219 (“Kaby Lake”) gigabit ethernet chip support in the `e1000g` driver
* ACPI Version 6 support
* Public documentation of `libproc(3LIB)`
* Initial support for ISO/IEC 9899:2011 (C11) standards
* Various man page cleanups
* DTrace now supports "if" and "else" statements.
* ZFS L2ARC now caches compressed data
* Many small/medium-sized ZFS improvements
