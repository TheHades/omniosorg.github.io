# OmniOS r151014

Please use `pkg update` to insure your LTS bits are at the latest
version. We will not backport a lot, but because it's **Long-Term**, we
will not just let it languish either.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE:** OpenSSH can now be used as the system's default SSH daemon.
New installs of r151014 will install OpenSSH by default. To switch from
SunSSH to OpenSSH, run the following:

```
# /usr/bin/pkg install --no-backup-be --reject pkg:/network/ssh --reject pkg:/network/ssh/ssh-key --reject pkg:/service/network/ssh pkg:/network/openssh pkg:/network/openssh-server
```

To switch from OpenSSH back to SunSSH:

```
# /usr/bin/pkg install --no-backup-be --reject pkg:/network/openssh --reject pkg:/network/openssh-server pkg:/network/ssh pkg:/network/ssh/ssh-key pkg:/service/network/ssh
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Switching from SunSSH to OpenSSH will require commenting-out
`MaxAuthTriesLog` and `RhostsAuthentication` options in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
Also, both `ListenAddress` directives MUST be commented out (SunSSH has one
uncommented by default). The OpenSSH package will deliver a `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.new`
file to consult. This file is the recommended default configuration.

**IMPORTANT NOTE 2 (Thanks Andy Fiddaman)**: To continue allowing connections from
SunSSH, please add the following to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

`KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`

If you have ssh service entries in `/etc/pam.conf` you may need to update them.
For example, Andy needed to `s/sshd-kbdint/sshd/` to re-enable their two-factor
authentication.

Please read the [upgrade instructions](/release/upgrade_to_r151014) carefully.

#### What's new in this release?

  who [upgrade](/legacy/upgrade_to_r151014) will set this policy themselves as part
  of the [documented upgrade process](/legacy/upgrade_to_r151014). New ISO or Kayak
  installations will have the “omnios” publisher's policy set
* Kayak servers that install 014 MUST use an 014 miniroot.gz. This is available
