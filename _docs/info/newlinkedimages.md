# Linked-Image Changes for r151022 and Later.

A side-effect of upgrading to Python 2.7 was updating pkg(5) to a more
modern upstream from Oracle Solaris and OpenIndiana.

This changed some semantics of Linked-image zones. Linked-image zones are no
longer as strictly linked to the parent (global-zone) image as they were. The
`-r` flag in pkg(1) can be used to maintain strict child-image (non-global
`lipkg` zone) updates. Some packages (like `system/library`) have explicit
parent-image dependencies, which means they will still always be updated
alongside the global zone. Most other packages now do not have to synchronize
their child-images, or required to be in-sync with their parent images.

Here is an example between a global zone and a single linked-image
non-global zone, showing that non-parent-dependent `shell/bash` can be updated.
Note that from the global zone, the non-global zone is updated only with `-r`.
And also note that inside the non-global zone, it can update without the
parent having to do so as well.
