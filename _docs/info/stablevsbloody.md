# Stable vs. Bloody

**OmniOS stable** is designed to be run in production with minimal
disruption. This means we release updates in a way to minimise service
disruption (reboot). Kernel updates are only made if they are security-
or stability-related and no work-around exists. User-space applications
can be treated more aggressively, but we're still conservative.
Non-disruptive updates are made available weekly (if there's anything to
update) and a full stable release is done every six months. Updates to
new stable releases will always require a reboot.

Stable releases occur at approximately 6-month intervals and have even
numbers, such as r151022, which was released in May 2017.

**OmniOS bloody** incorporates user-land updates and kernel updates in
an aggressive fashion and updates are made available as they are
introduced via IPS.

## Release Media

The only time we see install media rolled for stable is if there is a
specific security or installation-related issue addressed by a change.
Install media for bloody are updated periodically but not on a set
schedule.

Users can always obtain the latest-available packages on their systems
via `pkg update`.
